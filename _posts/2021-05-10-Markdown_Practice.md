Prayer for Gaben and thee RNGesus of holiness, let thou watch over our skins, and bless us with knives.  
Thou who has been brought to scammation, let us pray for their sake.  
Prayer Excepert from *Thy Book of CSGO, Excerpts 1-1000* number 243.  

Let us Pray.<br/>
Our Father Who AWPs in heaven<br/>
CS be thy game,<br/>
Uncase begun, them skins be won, Convert- and not a Mil-Spec.<br/>
Give us this day a StatTrak knife,<br/>
And forgive us when we rage quit,<br/>
As we forgive those who aimbot against us.<br/>
And lead us not into scamnation,<br/>
Undeliver us a Battle Scarred<br/>
Gaben.<br/>
