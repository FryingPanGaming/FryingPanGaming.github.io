Prayer for Steam, CS:GO, and all that is making 9 year olds rage quit.<br/>
Thou who has been brought to scammation, let us pray for their sake.<br/>
Prayer Excepert from *Thy Book of CSGO, Excerpts 1-1000* number 256.<br/> 

Let us Pray.<br/>
Our Gaben in Steam,<br/>
Hallowed be your Lordship,<br/>
Our Steam may come,<br/>
Your CS skins be done,<br/>
As Steam as in Valve,<br/>
Give us today our daily Skins,<br/>
Forgive us our Comp loses,<br/>
As we forgive those who lose against us,<br/>
Save us from the time of Origin,<br/>
And deliver us from EA,<br/>
For the Kingdom of Steam, the power of CS and the money are yours,<br/>
Now and forever GABEN AK'BAR<br/>
