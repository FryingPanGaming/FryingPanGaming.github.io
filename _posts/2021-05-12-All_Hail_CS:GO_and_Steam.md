Prayer for Steam, CS:GO, and all that is making 9 year olds rage quit.<br/>
Thou who has been brought to scammation, let us pray for their sake.<br/>
Prayer Excepert from *Thy Book of CSGO, Excerpts 1-1000* number 256.<br/> 

Let us Pray.<br/>
Our Gaben in Steam,<br/>
Hallowed be your Lordship,<br/>
Our Steam may come,<br/>
Your CS skins be done,<br/>
As Steam as in Valve,<br/>
Give us today our daily Skins,<br/>
Forgive us our Comp loses,<br/>
As we forgive those who lose against us,<br/>
Save us from the time of Origin,<br/>
And deliver us from EA,<br/>
For the Kingdom of Steam, the power of CS and the money are yours,<br/>
Now and forever GABEN AK'BAR<br/>

Underneath are the TEN Commandants made by Legendary  
CSGO Player Nade King  

Thou Shan't Use AK unless thou arte gay
Thou Shan't Use Big Mac 10 unless thou art American  
Thou Shan't use shotguns unless thou is Russian Smurf  
Thou Should say GG no matter if win OR loss  
Thou Shan't say GG EZ no matter if win OR loss  
Thou Shan't rage quit, it makes you look like a wimp   
Thou Shan't aimbot, for it makes you look gay  
Thou Should pray to RNGesus for a random spread headshot  
Thou Should relive your 9 year old COD experiences by T bagging a person whom you got a cheeky kill out of  
Thou Should use the stuppidest loadouts, unless Thou is is silver

Endeth.
