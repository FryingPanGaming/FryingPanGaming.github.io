I hate my PC so much. I cant even fricking run Roblox Studios, without it crashing. Then, whenever I load a game, my computer starts overheating as heck and it burns my hands to play. Thus, I have decided to put ice on the keyboard while playing. However, there are some drawbacks, such as getting wet fingers and electrocution, but obviously, wet fingers is much more annoying.
